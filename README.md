Okay I somehow got through homeworks, projects, and final tests, and am finally able to bootstrap CMake from pure Zig, a working ninja (which I'm bootstrapping soon so no worry), and a CMake source tree.

Working on Linux, of course, and one meter away (I think) from working on Windows. Lack some VSGenerator and MSYSMakefileGenerator functions for the stage-1 CMake. Since stage-1 CMake is supposed to used only with ninja, I think we can just patch it or provide dummy functions in a new C++ source unit. However I just got one more exam tomorrow morning. Let me take a breath.

Check out [someday](https://github.com/vspefs/someday-dev), what this project (and [ayc-libuv](https://github.com/vspefs/ayc-libuv), [ayc-jsoncpp](https://github.com/vspefs/ayc-jsoncpp)) ultimately contributes to. It's a project that allows you to use any C++ package from any build system/any package manager on any platform, integrating them to your build.zig, with nothing but a functional Zig toolchain!
